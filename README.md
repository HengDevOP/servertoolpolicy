🔑 Server Manager Responsibilities

1️⃣ Permission Management

To ensure Server Tool operates correctly, server administrators must properly manage bot permissions. This includes:
✅ Granting the bot appropriate roles (e.g., Manage Channels, Kick Members, Send Messages).
✅ Avoiding unnecessary permission bypasses that could lead to bot misuse.

2️⃣ Bot Role & Permission Risks

The bot cannot override server permissions on its own. However, if the bot is granted high-level roles (such as Administrator), it may bypass certain restrictions.
⚠️ Caution: Assigning the bot to trusted roles is necessary to prevent unauthorized use.

3️⃣ Handling Misuse or Exploits

If a user gains unintended access to bot features due to misconfigured permissions, it is the server owner’s responsibility to:
🔹 Review and adjust bot roles
🔹 Remove unauthorized users from powerful roles
🔹 Report any security concerns

⚠️ Agreement & Disclaimer

By adding Server Tool to your server, you agree to the following:
✅ The bot is provided “as-is” without any guarantees.
✅ The server owner is responsible for managing permissions and bot usage.
✅ Server Tool is not liable for any server issues arising from improper role assignments or misuse of the bot’s features.

⚠️ Use caution when granting high-level roles to untrusted members, as they may exploit bot permissions.
